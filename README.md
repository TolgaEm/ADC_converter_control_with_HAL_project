#  ADC_converter_control_with_HAL_project
## STM32F103 Cortex-M3 Project 

**we used STM32F103RB Nucleo Board and STMCUBE Ä°DE**

**we used HAL library for this sample**

**it's basic concept of ADC converter**

**you can convert any analog digitals (temperature,distance sensor vs)**

**you can read any analog signal by main code**
